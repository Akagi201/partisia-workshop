# DeFi Common

Contains common functionality for Partisia DeFi contracts.

## Deploy

Provides contract deployment. Used for example by `dex-swap-factory` to repeatedly deploy new swap contracts.

## Interact MPC20

Used to create and interact with [MPC20 Token Contracts](https://partisiablockchain.gitlab.io/documentation/smart-contracts/integration/mpc-20-token-contract.html). Used for example by `liquidity-swap` as the token contract.

## Permission

Provides a permission system for who is allowed to interact with a contract. Used for example in `dex-swap-factory`, to specify who can change deployed swap contracts.

## Token Balances

Provides a data structure for tracking pairwise token balances. Does not actually store the balances. Used for example by `liquidity-swap` to keep track of swap balances internally, while the actually tokens are at their respective contracts.

## Math

Contains generic math operations which may be useful across multiple contracts.
