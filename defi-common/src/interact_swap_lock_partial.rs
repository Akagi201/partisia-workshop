//! # Liquidity Swap Lock invocation helper
//!
//! Mini-library for creating interactions with Liquidity Swap Lock contracts.
//! Such contracts possesses the same interactions as [regular swap contracts](`crate::interact_swap`),
//! but with additional interactions for locking liquidity swaps.
//!
//! Only the additional interactions are described and implemented here.
//!
//! Assumes that the target contract possesses actions where the shortname and arguments matches
//! the following:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[action(shortname=0x07)] acquire_swap_lock(token_in: Address, amount_in: TokenAmount, amount_out_minimum: TokenAmount);
//! #[action(shortname=0x08)] execute_lock_swap(lock_id: LiquidityLockId);
//! #[action(shortname=0x09)] cancel_lock(lock_id: LiquidityLockId);
//! ```
